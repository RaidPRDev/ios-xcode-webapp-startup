## Prerequisites

#### You need a Mac ;-)

#### XCode

Before you can start, you need to have XCode 9.0.0 or greater installed on your machine.<br>
To download visit https://developer.apple.com/xcode/

#### Apple Developer License
This might seem obvious but you will need a Apple Developer License in order to make a final build and publish. With the license you can create your app and application id which you will need when you configure the app's project manifest and build script file.<br>
